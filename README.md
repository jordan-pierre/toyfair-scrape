# toyfair-scrape
Program gets every exhibitor at the 2018 NY Toy Fair and creates a csv file with a link to that name on
Google and Amazon by scraping the dynamic floor plan website for the exhibitor name tags using regex and
adding search links to both Amazon and Google so they are immediately clickable when research is done in Excel.
